**ADVANTAGES**

Perfomance: </br>
Loading and processing JSON data directly in memory can be faster than accessing external sources, especially for small to medium-sized data sets.

Memory Usage: </br>
It is important to monitor and optimize memory usage when working with JSON in memory, to avoid excessive resource consumption.

Data Persistence: </br>
JSON data in memory does not persist between program executions, so it may be necessary to load them from files or databases when needed.

Unit and Integration Testing: </br>
JSON Memory Testing allows for more isolated and controlled testing of functionality that handles JSON data, without relying on external sources.

Scenario Simulation: </br>
Generating and testing with fictional JSON data in memory facilitates the simulation of diferent application usage scenarios.
